consistent conventions for 
    name variables, 
    types,
    routines,
    the extent permitted by .... 
    indentation style

seeks to maximize readability and understanding

name variables:
    longer evocative names -> global variables && routines
    shorter names -> local variables

routines:
    short, no more than a page of code
    routines names -> 
                    chosen to reflect what the procedures do
                    and 
                    what the functions return

keep comments to a minimum
